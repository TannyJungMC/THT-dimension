A small datapack that added my void dimension from [Tan's Huge Trees](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tan-huge-trees) mod back to your world. Not important unless you remove the mod and it don't let you to play your world because of error "missing dimension".

My dimension only use for generate trees from system called "Auto Gen", not a place to explore.
